Image Preprocessing: Before passing the image to the text detection function, you can perform some preprocessing steps such as noise removal, thresholding, and morphological operations (like dilation) to enhance the text in the image.
Scale Images: The EAST text detector works best on text that is approximately 20 pixels in height. You can resize your images so that the text in your images is approximately this height.
Improve Non-Maxima Suppression: The non-maxima suppression method you’re using is based on the overlap of bounding boxes. Sometimes, text boxes can be close to each other and may have some overlap, but they should not be suppressed. You can consider using a more sophisticated method for non-maxima suppression that takes into account the proximity of boxes and their angle of rotation.
Use a More Robust OCR Engine: Tesseract works well for many use cases, but there might be other OCR engines that could give you better results depending on your specific use case. For example, the OCR.space API, Google Cloud Vision API, or Microsoft’s Azure Cognitive Services might provide better results.
Train a Custom Model: If you have a specific type of text you want to detect (e.g., a specific font or handwriting), you could consider training a custom model using machine learning. This would involve gathering a dataset of images with the specific text you’re interested in and training a model to detect this text.
